Netmindz is an exciting and ambitious project that is currently in the active development stage, poised to revolutionize the social media landscape within university communities. Leveraging the power of Django Rest Framework, WebSockets, and Celery, Netmindz's backend API is designed to create a seamless and engaging platform for university students and faculty. Through Django Rest Framework, the API provides a structured and efficient way to manage data, ensuring secure and consistent interactions.
